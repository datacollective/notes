[Open Data is a public good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data#Open_Data_as_commons). As a result, individual incentives are not aligned with collective ones.

As an organization or research group, [spending time curating and maintaining datasets for other people to use doesn't make economic sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics_of_open_data), unless you can profit from that.

The current landscape has a few problems:

- **Non Interoperability**. Data is isolated in multiples places and between different formats.
- **Data Loss**. Data is commonly stored in perishable hardware and formats.
- **Hard to Search**. Datasets indexing is difficult since [there are many standards](https://xkcd.com/927/).
- **No Collaboration**. No incentives exists for people to work on improving or curating datasets.

[Open Data can help organizations, scientist, and governments make better decisions](https://twitter.com/patrickc/status/1256987283141492736). Data is one of the best ways to learn about the world and coordinatepeople.

Open protocols create open systems. Open code creates tools. **Open data creates open knowledge**. We need better tools, protocols, and mechanisms to improve the Open Data ecosystem. It should be easy to find, download, process, publish, and collaborate on open datasets.

Iterative improvements over public datasets yield large amounts of value ([check how Dune did it with blockchain data](https://dune.com/blog/the-community-data-platform))ยน. Access to data gives people the opportunity to create new business and make better decisions.

Open Source code has made a huge impact in the world. Let's make Open Data do the same! Let's make it possible for [anyone to fork and re-publish fixed, cleaned, reformatted datasets as easily as we do the same things with code](https://juan.benet.ai/blog/2014-02-21-data-management-problems/).
