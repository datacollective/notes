# Data Collective Notes

A collection of notes on Open Data by the people and for the people!

In an hypothetical analogy with an art collective, this is:

- People with shared interest and *practice*
- Support for each other in path and efforts
- A place to hangout and have fun
- Do "exhibitions together"
- Some degree of shared identity (e.g. exhibitions done under this shared banner)
- Informal (no formal structure), no economic ties

## Focus

- Have our [knoweldgebase / digital garden](https://datahub.io/notes)
  - Consolidate / update / clean old Datahub notes
- Fireside chats idea clarified
- Community building (even if just us)
  - Coworking space / sessions
  - Connection calls
- Newsletter

## Vision

A collaborative initiative focused on democratizing data and empowering communities through open data solutions. The key aspects are:

- **Data Collective**: Building a cooperative-like organization for data infrastructure and curation, inspired by the Mondragon Corporation model.
- **Community Empowerment**: Providing open data to help local communities make informed decisions.
- **Open Data Framework**: Developing protocols and tools to improve the production, sharing, consumption, and collaboration on open datasets.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Curating and creating data-informed analyses, similar to "Our World in Data" but with a more inclusive, collaborative approach.
- **Cooperative Data Agency**: Establishing a sustainable, values-driven enterprise that offers data services with a focus on cooperation and democratization.
- **Innovative Monetization**: Exploring new incentive structures and monetization strategies for data across communities.
- **Long-Term Vision**: Creating a "data treasurehouse" that preserves and curates valuable information over time.
- **Values and Culture**: Embodying core values of cooperation, democratization, and transparency throughout the project's work and organizational structure.

The ultimate goal is to create a **more democratic, egalitarian, and innovative approach to data** that could potentially replace or complement existing data giants like Google or Bloomberg.

In all of these, our intuition has converged on fact that to create something impactful means quality and sustainability which means income which means an enterprise.

Specifically we an imagine:

- Services cooperative
  - Data engineering (building data infrastructure / fabric / management)
  - Data analysis / science
  - Data concierge (find and preparing data)
- Products (cooperative)
  - Data engineering tools (product) cooperative
- Data marketplace (cooperative) - original data collective vision
