**Make it stupidly easy, fast and reliable to share data in a *useable*<sup>a</sup> way<sup>b</sup>**

Easy for whom? Power data users. People familiar with a command line and github. Data engineers, data scientists, data analysts ...

<sup>a</sup> It is already easy to "share" data: just use dropbox, google drive, s3, github etc. However, it’s not so easy to share it in a way that’s usable e.g. with descriptions for the columns, data that’s viewable and searchable (not just raw), with clearly associated docs, with an API etc.

<sup>b</sup> Not only with others but with yourself. This may sound a bit odd: don’t you already have the data? What we mean is, for example, going from a raw CSV to a browseable table (share it with your "eyes") or converting it to an API so that you can use it in a data driven app or analysis (sharing from one tool to another).
