### Blocks are the way to go

#todo/process

CMS have gone all block-y i.e. they use pages composed of blocks e.g. wordpress editor, notion.so etc. In a way blocks are just the good ol' dom nodes but with metadata and associated editor UI.

You also see this in headless editor work where they tend to talk about components.

We want to adopt this i suspect.

Concrete example: imagine a README.md with a dataset embedded in it somehow e.g.

```md
# My cool dataset

<TabularData src=""
```

Not quite getting the point across.
