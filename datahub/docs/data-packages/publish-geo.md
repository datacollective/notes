Publishing your Geodata as Data Packages is very easy.

You have two options for publishing your geodata:

* **Geo Data Package** (Recommended). This is a basic Data Package with the
  requirement that data be in GeoJSON and with a few special additions to the
  metadata for geodata. See the next section for instructions on how to do
  this.
* **Generic Data Package**. This allows you to publish geodata in any kind of
  format (KML, Shapefiles, Spatialite etc). If you choose this option you will
  want to follow the standard [instructions for packaging any kind of data as a
  Data Package][any].

We recommend Geo Data Package if that is possible as it makes it much easier
for you to use 3rd party tools with your Data Package. For example, the [data
package viewer][viewer] on this site will automatically preview a Geo Data Package.

> *Note: this document focuses on *vector* geodata &ndash; i.e. points, lines polygons etc (not
imagery or raster data).*
