# Vision

Our goal with the Data Collective is to **create a more democratic, egalitarian, and innovative approach to data** that is open, transparent, and community-driven. We believe that data is a public good and that everyone should have access to it. We want to make it easier for people to share, access, and use data in a way that is ethical, secure, and sustainable.
